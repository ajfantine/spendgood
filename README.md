# SpendGood
## Problem: overspending is common and money is a relative thing. How can we help improve people’s spending and saving habits using technology?
- A web app that has user spending information stored on it (firebase?)
Users can see visualize their spending habits (microstrategy? Not very novel)
- Users can create custom saving plans based on system recommendations (things they are spending too much money on, how much they can have in x time if they save y amount, machine learning? Datasets? statistics?)
- Show the users spending vs average spending on x thing
- Give them updates on their spending
- Visualization of your spending now based on past spending
- Say a user selects a saving plan, they can see how well they’ve stuck to it
- Visualize the saved money in terms of things they could purchase? Based on the users interests (“people like you have purchased xyz thing”)
